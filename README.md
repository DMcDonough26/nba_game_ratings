# nba_game_ratings
Python code to pull NBA scoreboard in real time and rate games based on their watchability.

I originally put this together during grad school as a fun side project to learn web scraping, and to also answer the practical question of which game I should throw on in the background while doing homework.

The jupyter notebook shows the steps in detail and the thought process behind them, but a python file is included as well to run all at once from the command line.
